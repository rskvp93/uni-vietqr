Uni-VietQR is an open-source initiative that standardizes how VietQR codes are generated and decoded across different systems in Vietnam. It aims to unify the implementation of VietQR in a developer-friendly, bank-agnostic way.

What Uni-VietQR Is:
	•	“Uni” = Unified / Universal
	•	“VietQR” = Vietnam’s QR code standard for bank transfers

So, Uni-VietQR provides a universal way to generate, parse, and validate VietQR codes — mainly used for seamless bank transfers via QR in Vietnam.

Main Features:

✅ Generate QR codes based on VietQR format
✅ Parse existing VietQR codes to extract info like bank, account number, amount, message, etc.
✅ Bank-agnostic — works with many Vietnamese banks
✅ Follows the EMVCo standard (the global QR payment format used in VietQR)

Typical Use Cases:
	•	E-commerce platforms needing to generate QR codes for bank payments
	•	POS systems that want to integrate VietQR support
	•	Developers building mobile apps or tools for payment workflows in Vietnam
	•	Automating donation or invoice payment via QR

Example Fields in a Uni-VietQR Code:
	•	Bank ID (NAPAS standard)
	•	Account number
	•	Account name
	•	Amount (optional)
	•	Transfer message (optional)
